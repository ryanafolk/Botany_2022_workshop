# Phylodiversity practical -- Biodiversity Data Wrangling
The R script to run things is fagales.R (a simplified version of the analyses presented in this preprint: [https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.17.537249]. Clone the repository locally or use GitHub desktop, and set your working directory to the first-level directory inside the repository. You can follow along with the script, pasting codes in the spaced out blocks and making sure no errors are returned.

Here is a summary of the rest of the contents:

## fagales.R
Analysis script.

## README.md
This short guide.

## presentations
Copies of presentations.

## climate_data/PD_P_50km
Raw data representing climatic conditions at grid cells.

## Fagales_CSVs_ToShare
Raw data representing diversity statistics at grid cells. There are many more than we will use here. The file abbreviations are like so:

CANAPE.csv -- CANAPE significance categories (endemism analysis) 
PD_P_50km.csv -- Raw Phylogenetic Diversity (PD)
PMPD_50km.csv -- Phylogenetic Mean Pairwise Distance 
RPD_50km.csv -- Relative Phylogenetic Diversity (RPD)
RPE_50km.csv -- Relative Phylogenetic Endemism 
prop_nod.csv and proportion_nodulating.csv -- two versions of 
rand_PD_P_50km.csv -- Randomizations of PD
rand_RPD_50km.csv -- Randomizations of RPD
